(comment ;; ex5-test ; invoking (test 0 (p))
  "Invocations of (ch1/test 0 (ch1/p)) will never"
  " terminate, as long as test is a normal function;"
  " i.e. it uses applicative order evaluation, which"
  " will attempt to evaluate the infinitely recursive"
  " definition of p."
  " If test is a macro, i.e. it uses normal order"
  " evaluation, then it will not evaluate p until it"

(comment ;; ex6-test : sqrt-iter using new-if
  "new-if is a function, not a macro, so its arguments are"
  " evaluated before it is invoked (applicative order)."
  " Consequently, the sqrt-iter function will loop forever,"
  " as each invocation of new-if in sqrt-iter will result"
  " in another sqrt-iter call. This will stack overflow,"
  " since the function is not tail recursive.")
